# Time-Series

<h2> This repo consists of 2 Time-Series datasets solved in Python , using RNN</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    This dataset is gathered from kaggle :- <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset">https://www.kaggle.com/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset</a>

    Second one is weather timeseries dataset recorded at the Weather Station at the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry in Jena, Germany.4
    In this dataset, 14 different quantities (such air temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity, wind direction, and so on) were recorded every 10 minutes, over several             years. The data is from 2009â€“2016. 
    Download the data from following link :-<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/keras-datasets/jena_climate_2009_2016.csv.zip">https://s3.amazonaws.com/keras-datasets/jena_climate_2009_2016.csv.zip</a><br>
    This is a huge dataset ,and due to limited computational resourecs , a sub sample of this dataset is used to train the model.<br>
    <u><b> Note:-</b></u>You can use full dataset also , to achieve fascinating results.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <span class="nowrap"> <b>RNN(Recurrent Neural Networks)</b></span>are used in both models for time-series forecasting !!
